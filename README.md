# Analyzing Used Car Listings on eBay Kleinanzeigen
This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, the classifieds platform of the German eBay website. The dataset, originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle, has been sampled and includes 50,000 data points. This version simulates a less-cleaned dataset, providing an opportunity to apply various data cleaning techniques.

Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to clean the dataset and perform an in-depth analysis of the used car listings to extract insights and trends.
